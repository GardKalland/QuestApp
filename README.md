# QuestApp

The main goal of the is for you to keep track of mundaine things troughout the day or things you want to learn and keep track of goals you have set yourself.


This is all in development, So all the things in the description has not been added yet. (I will just add things when i think of them.)


## Daily quest
Making an daily quest app for my iphone. 

The app is for doing daily task and keeping a streak of it. 

You can have a maximum of 7 daily quests (So you dont overdue it and stop the quests)

The quests resets at midnight every day. If you dont do the quests one day you loose the streak, and yesterday goals will be incrementet onto the next day, where one of the tasks will be incrementet for that day. 
(i.e if you have learn a new language for 30min pr day. so Learning 30 min 0/1 it will become Learning 30min 0/2) There are no checking if you actually do the tasks, its a trust based system.

The daily quests can be reset once each month. (This is so that you well able to make a habit, aaaand so that you dont just add new things and not commit.)


## Yearly Goal
Yearly goal to keep track of what you want to have accomplished that year. 
You can troughout the year complete the quest on the app. 

(Going to add an option menu so if you missclick you can undo the goal)


This will be reset at the end of the year. 


You can have up to 10 goals for the year.
